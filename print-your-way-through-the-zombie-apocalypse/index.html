No power, no running water, no food.</p><p>It's always worth preparing for the worst, and as <a href="https://thecrow.uk/elegoo-neptune-4-max-large-format-3d-printer-review-at-homeneed-at-home/">we have a large-format 3D printer squirreled away in our lair</a>, printing the gear we would need to survive events triggered by a horde of brain-eating former hums should be both simple and cheap.</p><p>This is what we decided we'd need:</p><h2>A bicycle</h2><figure class="post__image align-center"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/bike_frame.png" alt="Screenshot of a thingiverse page showing a printed bike frame" width="1263" height="656" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/bike_frame-xs.png 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/bike_frame-sm.png 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/bike_frame-md.png 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/bike_frame-lg.png 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/bike_frame-xl.png 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/bike_frame-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>Cities are a dangerous place to be when there are zombies about. If there's a single zombie in your neighbourhood, you can be sure that more people will become infected, then suddenly there are dozens, hundreds, thousands even - all looking for fresh brains to eat and people to infect.</p><p>Getting out of town is the best option, and with the roads doubtless jammed with traffic, a bicycle is a great way to get you there.</p><p>There are hundreds of bicycle designs you can print, but most of them are miniatures, and scaling up won't leave you with a working two-wheeled conveyance.</p><p>Rather than printing an entire, full-sized bicycle, it's a better idea to print the parts that will allow you to build a frame from scavenged materials.</p><p><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:892442" data-md-href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:892442" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ColorFabb's 3D Printed bike</a> aims to do just that - proving joints into which you can slot frame tubes gears and the rest of what makes a bicycle. As we already have a stable of bikes out back, we're all ready to to. Make sure you are, too.</p><h2>Fishing rod</h2><p>After an exhausting ride to a secluded brook in the countryside you're likely to be exhausted and in need of sustenance. Fish are easy to come by but difficult to catch without a rod.</p><p>On the other hand, a rod is bulky, difficult to carry, and will likely attract the attention of the roving hordes.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/sharky.png" alt="Blue and white Sharky fishing reel on a black background" width="1920" height="1290" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sharky-xs.png 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sharky-sm.png 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sharky-md.png 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sharky-lg.png 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sharky-xl.png 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sharky-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>The Sharky fishing rod, isn't actually a rod. It's fish-catching gear that's small enough to fit into your back pocket. It comprises a reel with a locking mechanism, and a quick release. There's also a hole for a carabiner in case you want to clip it to your belt. We built the Sharky - which is currently on V5 - but have yet to catch any fish. We put this down to our own lack of skill, rather than any inherent fault in the design. It's quick, easy, and we see know reason why it shouldn't work.</p><h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">A solar still</h2><figure class="post__image align-center"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/solar_still.png" alt="" width="576" height="395" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/solar_still-xs.png 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/solar_still-sm.png 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/solar_still-md.png 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/solar_still-lg.png 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/solar_still-xl.png 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/solar_still-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>Clean water is a must, and who knows what's died jut around the bend upstream of your little camp.</p><p>Solar stills purify water using the sun’s energy to mimic the natural water cycle through evaporation and condensation.</p><p>Depending on where you are in the world, the amount of water you get out of it will vary.</p><p><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3060478" data-md-href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3060478" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Super Steve's survival distiller</a> certainly looks the part, and requires mason jars, plastic piping, a computer fan, and either batteries or solar panels to run.</p><h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Bows and Crossbows</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/sailfish.jpg" alt="A blue and white repeating crossbow on a table" width="1600" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sailfish-xs.jpg 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sailfish-sm.jpg 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sailfish-md.jpg 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sailfish-lg.jpg 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sailfish-xl.jpg 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/sailfish-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>Regardless of how peace-loving you are, at some point you're going to need weaponry.

It's fast, and you really wouldn't want to be hit by one of these.</p><p>If you want to up your lethality, you can try the <a href="https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/slinghammer-convertion-kit-7-shoot-arrow-magazine">Slinghammer conversion kit</a>, which fires either 7.5-inch or 6.5-inch bolts. Would it kill a zombie? Maybe. Would it absolutely ruin its day? 100%.</p><p>Using the 7.5" bolts from the powerstroke model, we've gone clean through a roasting joint. We doubt it would go through bone though. The powerstroke package will give you an eight-bolt mag - which you can empty in about 10 seconds. We've not timed, but that feels about right.</p><p>The standard bolt chucker is less powerful as it has a shorter stroke, but comes with option of a 20-shot doublestack magazine.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/schwertwal.png" alt="A black and white repeating crossbow next to a chronograph at night" width="1600" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/schwertwal-xs.png 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/schwertwal-sm.png 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/schwertwal-md.png 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/schwertwal-lg.png 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/schwertwal-xl.png 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/95/responsive/schwertwal-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>So far we've printed both the powerstroke and standard models, equipped them with laser pointers, and dialled them in at 150 fps. If you want any oncoming zombies to resemble a porcupine, these will do the job.</p><p>We also printed the ball-bearing chucker for the daughter and equipped it with Theraband Gold elastic resistance fitness band. It can rapid-fire 12mm steel balls at 130 fps. Again, it's unlikely to kill a zombie, but it'll give it a hell of a headache.</p><p>Image credits:</p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@davieees?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Davide Aracri</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-with-a-lot-of-blood-on-the-face-cgF0E2mPjts?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></p><p><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:892442">ColorFabb</a> / <span class="alt-titles"><span class="tool-identifier"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a></span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3060478">Super Steve</a> / <span class="alt-titles"><span class="tool-identifier"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></span></p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fprint-your-way-through-the-zombie-apocalypse%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fprint-your-way-through-the-zombie-apocalypse%2F&amp;via=The%20Crow&amp;text=Print%20your%20way%20through%20the%20zombie%20apocalypse" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fprint-your-way-through-the-zombie-apocalypse%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F95%2Fprintpocalypse.png&amp;description=Print%20your%20way%20through%20the%20zombie%20apocalypse" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Pinterest"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://wa.me/?text=Print%20your%20way%20through%20the%20zombie%20apocalypse https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fprint-your-way-through-the-zombie-apocalypse%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Share with WhatsApp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><img class="u-author__avatar" src="https://thecrow.uk/media/website/me.avif" alt="David Rutland" height="false" width="false"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://thecrow.uk/authors/david-rutland/" title="David Rutland">David Rutland</a></h4><p>David is a freelance writer with a background in print journalism, and a love of Free and Open Source Software.
