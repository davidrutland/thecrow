Yes, I remember Christmas happening, and I had the best New Year’s eve party ever - with my wfe, my daughter, and myself cooking South African style in the back yard with a potjie purchased from <a href="https://boetsbiltong.co.uk/">Boet’s Biltong</a> (genuine recommendation), along with bread baked on cut willow sticks over the same fire. It was great.</p><p>But 2022 is difficult to comprehend - possibly because it seems that 2021 barely happened at all. I didn’t go anywhere, I saw very few people, and almost all news was on the same subject which has been preoccupying public consciousness since the beginning of 2020.</p><p>And yet, here we are. 2022. Hurray!</p><p>Some things will change this year, and having had a week to consider it, here’s what I think they are.</p><h2 id="nfts-will-become-worthless">NFTs will become worthless</h2><p>There’s silly money in NFTs right now, and I’ll be honest, and just say that I don’t really understand them. Or at least, I kind of get the explanation, but I don’t actually think there is any inherent value in them, and I also don’t think that the people who bought them believe there is any intrinsic value.</p><p>NFTs are a fad which will run out of steam as soon as the incredibly wealthy people who buy NFTs get bored of them. Sure there will be a short tale as ‘investors’ pour in their <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rrx88z/nft_pensions_am_i_crazy/">pension funds</a> in the hope of getting rich, but at some point in the coming months, NFTs are going to experience an <em>Emperor’s New Clothes</em> moment.</p><p>Paid a cool million for the NFT of a pixelated unicorn? Tough shit. I’m with <a href="https://thecrow.uk/jimmy-cauty-klf-orb-rockman-rock-talks-about-eft-million-pounds/">Jimmy Cauty</a> on this one.</p><h2 id="year-of-the-linux-desktop">Year of the Linux desktop!</h2><p>Lol. JK.</p><h2 id="search-engines-will-be-even-less-useful">Search engines will be even less useful</h2><p>SEO ruined the internet. Any topic is gamed by SEO marketers to get their site to the front page of Google. If you’re a freelance writer (as I am) you will often see jobs listings looking for <em>contents writers</em> in niches as diverse as garden furniture and CBD. The proportion of genuine content by people who know and care about what they write about, is vanishingly small.</p><p>The ability to find what you’re looking for isn’t helped by search engines deliberately crippling themselves. Boolean operators don’t work any more - or are treated as guidelines at best. Google wants to show you what it thinks you want to see - not what you actually specified using exact, albeit outdated, terminology and operators.</p><p>Yes, some of the old operators still work, but it’s getting worse</p><p>I cannot see this getting better any time soon. Rather than providing an up-to-date manual of useful commands we can use to specify <em>exactly</em> what we want to find, search engines are trying to introduce a form of learned helplessness which will allow them to feed us whatever SEO optimised crap makes them money.</p><p>Side note: You should read Kev Quirk’s ‘manifesto’ at <a href="https://thewebisfucked.com/">thewebisfucked.com</a></p><h2 id="grant-shapps-for-uk-prime-minister">Grant Shapps for UK Prime Minister</h2><p>I think that our current Prime Minister’s days are numbered. yes the party has a huge majority, but it’s painfully obvious he doesn’t know what he’s doing. I think the only reason Boris still in the job is because no-one else wants to take over right now.</p><p>I think the Tories will remain in power, but once the current crisis passes, there is going to be a new leader.</p><p>My money is on <a href="https://thecrow.uk/A-Gov.uk-site-dedicated-to-porn-Absolutely/">Grant Shapps</a> - currently transport secretary - as the least offensive of an obnoxious bunch.</p><p>If this comes to pass, please try to remember that the man is a Two bit grifter who used to make money selling, for almost $500, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/revealed-grant-shapps-getrichquick-guide-or-it-that-michael-green-s-8209978.html">a toolkit promising customers earnings of $20,000 in 20 days</a>. Upon purchase, the ‘toolkit’ was revealed to be an ebook, advising the user to create their own toolkit and recruit 100 ‘Joint Venture Partners’ to resell it for a share of the profits.</p><p>Shapps is probably the best and most honest of the potential candidates.</p><h2 id="have-a-great-2022">Have a great 2022!</h2><p>Stay safe and enjoy yourselves responsibly. Don’t swallow SD cards.</p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fthe-crows-predictions-for-2022-better-late-than-never%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fthe-crows-predictions-for-2022-better-late-than-never%2F&amp;via=The%20Crow&amp;text=The%20Crow's%20predictions%20for%202022%20(better%20late%20than%20never)" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fthe-crows-predictions-for-2022-better-late-than-never%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F32%2Fthe_crow_predictions_2022.jpg&amp;description=The%20Crow's%20predictions%20for%202022%20(better%20late%20than%20never)" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Pinterest"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://wa.me/?text=The%20Crow's%20predictions%20for%202022%20(better%20late%20than%20never) https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fthe-crows-predictions-for-2022-better-late-than-never%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Share with WhatsApp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><img class="u-author__avatar" src="https://thecrow.uk/media/website/me.avif" loading="lazy" alt="David Rutland" height="false" width="false"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://thecrow.uk/authors/david-rutland/" title="David Rutland">David Rutland</a></h4><p>David is a freelance writer with a background in print journalism, and a love of Free and Open Source Software.
