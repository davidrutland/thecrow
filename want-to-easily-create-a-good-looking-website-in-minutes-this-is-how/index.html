Sure, you could go for a run, or engage in some sort of sport. But it's too cold outside (or maybe too hot, or to wet). Play a computer game? Scroll through TikTok or the 'gram? Watch TV?</p><p>Sure. These are some OK ways to pass the time, and they'll stave off the inevitable ennui that comes with having nothing to do.</p><p>You could read, sure, but isn't it better to write?</p><p>Shitposting Engaging in discourse on Facebook / Reddit / The Fediverse / X is a waste of time. Once you spit your words into the character-limited text box, they're not yours anymore. And they'll vanish when your account is deleted, else be disappeared into the depths of 'the algorithm' never to surface again.</p><p>If you create your own website, you can write whatever you want without limits (bar legal ones). You're not restricted with an arbitrary wordcount, or a set layout, or topic or anything else.</p><p>You can post pictures, write about your day, your hobby, advertise your business, talk about cats, or religion, or politics. And when you've finished you can share it to your social media friends and followers and be proud of what you've done.</p><p>And it doesn't have to be difficult. You can easily create a website from scratch for free.</p><h2 id="h-static-sites-are-lighter-faster-and-in-most-cases-better">Static sites are lighter, faster, and (in most cases) better</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/crow_fullscreen.png" alt="Front page of thecrow.uk" width="1917" height="964" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/crow_fullscreen-xs.png 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/crow_fullscreen-sm.png 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/crow_fullscreen-md.png 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/crow_fullscreen-lg.png 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/crow_fullscreen-xl.png 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/crow_fullscreen-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>The majority of the sites you visit on the internet are created and managed using a web-based Content Management System (CMS) such as WordPress. A CMS is actually made up up of two parts: a content management application, into which you log in, create posts and organise your articles, and a content delivery application that converts your content into a web page that visitors can see. </p><p>Web-based CMSes are great, but they come with a significant overhead, and your site may struggle under heavy loads. An unless you host your site on your own server, you'll have to pay for hosting.</p><p>Static sites are a collection of web pages. A web browser requests a particular page, and the server sends an HTML document back. They're insanely fast, there's very little behind-the-scenes work, and you can get no-strings-attached hosting for free.</p><p><a href="https://linuximpact.com"></a><a href="https://thecrow.uk">The Crow</a> is a static site.</p><p>There was a time when to create pages for a website, you needed to be able to understand and Use HTML. That time is long gone, and you don't ever need to be able to use a code-editor in order to create a fabulous-looking, attractive website quickly.</p><p>Static Site Generators (SSGs) act as an offline content management app, and convert your words and images to HTML files that you can push to any server.</p><p>One final advantage to having a static site rather than an online CMS is security. If someone can log into your CMS admin panel with a cracked or stolen password, or exploit a security flaw in a plugin, it's game over. With static pages, there's nothing to log into. It's safer and more secure. </p><p>We've tried dozens over the years and can say with absolute certainty that none of them offer the same ease-of-use, friendly interface, and customisation options as Publii. </p><h2 id="h-get-publii">Get Publii!</h2><p>Publii is packaged as a binary (executable file), and is available from <a href="https://getpublii.com/">getpublii.com</a>. Download and install it according to the instructions on the site.</p><p>Open Publii for the first time, and you'll be guided through the process of making a website. You'll pick an avatar, and a name for your website.</p><p>After that, it's worthwhile creating a few test posts to see how everything works. It's best if already have some posts ready-to-go, but if not, some Lorum Ipsum text and royalty free images will do. Or hey, you could actually focus on writing instead of messing round with configuration and looks.</p><h3 id="h-create-your-first-publii-posts">Create your first Publii posts</h3><p>Create a post for the first time, and you have a choice of what kind of editor you want to use. If you're coming from WordPress, or have experience with that CMS, the block editor is probably your best choice. Alternatively, the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor will give you an experience similar to that of a traditional word processor, with formatting options laid out along the top. The Markdown editor uses (unsurprisingly) Markdown, which is a lighweight language you can use to add formatting to text documents. If you're interested in Markdown, check out <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">markdownguide.org</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, if you already have your content published on a WordPress site, and are swapping to Publii because of the massive performance boost that comes with a static site, go to <strong>Tools &amp; Plugins &gt; WP Importer</strong> to start automatically importing your content, images, authors, and tags.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/publii-wysiwyg-editor-md.webp" alt="The Publii wysiwyg editor showing the content of this article" width="768" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>In all three editors, you'll have access to a collapsible menu on the right side of the screen. In here, you'll find some supremely useful options. In the top section, you can configure the post author, and attributes including whether the article is classed as featured, whether to exclude it from your homepage, or even hide it completely.</p><p>Below this, you can set the featured image, together with alt text for visually impaired readers, captions, and credits.</p><p>The <strong>Tags</strong> section is important. These are the categories in which an article will appear on your site. It governs what shows up as a related article, and forms the basis of the menu structure.</p><p>In the SEO section you can tune your site to be more (or less) friendly for search engines. In <strong>Post Slug</strong>, you can customise your URL, change the itle, and meta description, and choose whether you want search engines to index the page.</p><p>Lastly, there's the <strong>other options</strong>, there are too many to cover here, but they allow you to tweak the way your post appears, and make it different from other posts on the site. Nothing major - options to show the date, author, tags and so on.</p><p>Return to the <strong>Posts</strong> menu, and preview your changes. Publii will open a local copy of your site in the default browser.</p><h2 id="h-make-your-publii-website-pretty">Make your Publii website pretty</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/marketplace-md.webp" alt="Publii marketplace with a collection of themes" width="768" height="384" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/marketplace-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/marketplace-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/marketplace-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/marketplace-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/marketplace-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/marketplace-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>By default, you'll only have the <strong>Simple</strong> theme installed. It's pretty good, and will render a classic list of posts with excerpts for your front page, along with a very nice layout for the articles themselves.</p><p>To truly customise your site, head over to the <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/themes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Publii marketplace</a>. There isn't a huge quantity of themes (27 at the time of writing), but are all high quality, with examples suitable for everything from image galleries and basic blogs to feature heavy documentation sites and magazines. Around a third of the themes are completely free, with the rest priced at around $30. You'll have to download your theme manually, and upload and select it through the Publii interface. Don't worry though, the excellent documentation makes it a breeze.</p><p>We considered the excellent <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/themes/editorial-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Editorial</a> theme, but eventually settled on the fantastic looking, free, and functional <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/themes/technews/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Technews</a> you're looking at now.</p><h2 id="h-whats-on-the-menu">What's on the menu?</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/settings-md.webp" alt="Publii custom settings for themes" width="768" height="419" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/settings-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/settings-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/settings-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/settings-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/settings-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/settings-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>In the <strong>Theme</strong> menu (accessible the the nav bar on the left), you can further refine your spanky new theme to look and behave exactly how you want it to. <strong>Basic settings</strong> include pagination, excerpt length, and site logo, while the fun stuff is slightly further down in <strong>Custom settings</strong>.</p><p>Customising WordPress themes can be a bitch unless you invest some serious time into learning CSS - and who has time for that?</p><p>In contrast, customising a Publii theme is simplicity itself: there are sliders, you can type in values for column width, or select layout options from a dropdown.</p><p>Want expandable submenus on mobile? toggle the radio button. Fed up with the colour scheme? Choose some new hues with the colour-picker. Corners too rounded or too sharp? adjust the slider. Easy-peasy. Want Social share buttons or a search box? This is where you'll find them.</p><p>Navigation is key to making any website usable, and the tags you create when making a post form the basis of Publii's menu system. The primary tag (you can select this with a dropdown) is displayed on the posts page and front page of the site, but secondary tags are important, too.</p><p>Take for instance, our article on setting up your own XMPP server on a Raspberry Pi in under five minutes. The primary tag is self-hosted, and but it's also tagged as DIY, Internet, Linux, Privacy, Raspberry Pi, Software, and Tips. These tags influence the <strong>Related</strong> <strong>posts</strong>, you see at the bottom of the page. More importantly they mean that if a menu item is linked to that tag, the post will appear in that section of the site.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/menus-md.webp" alt="Creating and editing menus with Publii" width="768" height="416" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/menus-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/menus-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/menus-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/menus-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/menus-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/56/responsive/menus-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p><strong>Menus</strong> has its own item on the navigation sidebar. Click <strong>Add New Menu</strong>, and give it a name, then <strong>Add new menu item</strong>. You can add menu links to individual posts, such as an <strong>about</strong> page; to a <strong>tag link</strong> (this is how we do our category menus); to author pages; the front page; external links; internals; whatever. Simple eh?</p><h2 id="h-publish-your-website-with-publii">Publish your website with Publii</h2><p>You can spend hours customising your theme, and tweaking it to be exactly how you want it to be, but you'll be better off putting that time into writing.</p><p>When you're happy with the way your site looks, and have some quality content to give to the world, it's time to publish.</p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Before you can do this, make sure you have a domain name.
