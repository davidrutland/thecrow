Accomplish anything".</p><p>But enshitification inevitably ensues as financial interests force users onto so-called premium plans. Limitations are imposed, and features deprecated.</p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/evernote-plans-md.webp" alt="Evernote plans ranging from free to 13.49 per month" width="768" height="383" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/evernote-plans-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/evernote-plans-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/evernote-plans-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/evernote-plans-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/evernote-plans-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/evernote-plans-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p>Some of those users will pay a premium once their free trial expires, but most probably won't want to fork over more than $100 per year for the privilege - they're happy with the 60 MB monthly uploads, and other limitations. Or they just drift away.</p><p>For a while, enough people found Evernote's premium features useful enough to to keep it just about afloat, and in the late 2010s, the company boasted a quarter billion users and a recurring revenue of $100 million - after mass layoffs in 2015 and 2018.</p><p>Milan-based app developer, Bending Spoons, acquired Evernote in early 2023, and almost immediately fired a further 129 staff.</p><p>Reducing headcount evidently wasn't enough to return the kind of profits the new owners were hoping for, and in an effort to claw more paying subscribers on board, Evernote is limiting the number of notebooks available for free users to a paltry <a href="https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-free-note-limits">50 notes and one notebook</a>.</p><p>Want to keep compartmentalised notes for your timetable, meetings, hobbies, pets, and other such essentials? Pay up, loser.</p><p>We don't know about you, but we can sometimes write more than 50 notes in a single day. Backup brain? More like back of an envelope.</p><p>It's not a good look, and effectively cripples the software unless, of course, you're willing to cough up the cash in monthly installments.</p><p>It's not like you can just buy Evernote outright, either. It's a service, and you pay forever.</p><p>Fortunately, there's a free and open-source Evernote alternative you can run either as a local app, or as a full-blown, cross-platform, synchronised notebook.

The employees obviously weren't that essential.</p><p>But for a single user set-up, running at home, your outlay is essentially zero. You can buy a domain name for pennies or a few dollars from <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/m5kVrO">Namecheap</a>, and you can dump server software onto an <a href="https://thecrow.uk/turn-your-old-pc-or-laptop-into-a-server-and-own-your-own-piece-of-the-internet/">old laptop</a> or a cheap, always-on SBC such as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16G7DHNEVDVBH&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+8gb&amp;qid=1699266630&amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+8gb%252Caps%252C152&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=0f9dee46e8b8e6c27a2421c530833bac&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p><p>So let's talk about <a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium">Trilium Notes</a>' features.</p><p>It's described by the devs as being, "a hierarchical note taking application with focus on building large personal knowledge bases." Not quite as catchy as, "Remember everything. Accomplish anything", but essentially that's what it offers.</p><p>That's a pretty accurate description, and essentially means that you write down things that you want to remember, and Trilium gives you a way to keep it all organised. You can create notebooks, and notebooks within those notebooks, ad infinitum. And it's not just notes, either - you can store images, files and arbitrary data, and you can link notes to other notes, and one note can appear in multiple notebooks.</p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/trilium-notes-map-md.webp" alt="A concept map of Trilium notes" width="768" height="365" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-notes-map-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-notes-map-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-notes-map-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-notes-map-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-notes-map-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-notes-map-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p>It sounds complicated, but it's as complicated or as simple as you want to make it. Keeping track of what you've jotted, photographed, or stored isn't complicated either - there's an excellent search function, as well as a sort-of map view that shows you what is related to what, and how. You can tag, you can filter, and you can find what you're looking for.</p><p>Taking notes is easy, too. You can write in markdown, or you can use the excellent WYSIWG editor. Copy and paste, attach files, whatever. It's very easy to use.</p><p>Your notes can have infinite children, and they can be anything: code samples, relationship maps, saved searches, or you can embed a webpage with webview.</p><p>If you've created a document in Trilium, and decide you want to share it with the world, that's simple as well, and Trilium will generate a link to share your beautifully formatted document as a web page.</p><p>That's not to say that Trilium is the perfect note-taking software - it isn't. The web interface is great, the desktop apps are fantastic, but we'd really appreciate some full-fat dedicated mobile apps for iOS and Android. We also think that Evernote's OCR is pretty spiffy, and Trilium would be improved with some similar functionality.</p><p>We'd also quite like some support for multiple users on the same instance.</p><p>These aren't deal-breakers though, and to our minds, Trilium Notes is still the best around if you don't want to be bled dry by subscriptions.</p><p>We're using Trilium Notes to organise our life and our work. We have a dedicated notebook for Linux Impact with sub-notebooks for cool self-hosted projects, TUI stuff, GUI, distros, and so on - all rich, and filled with images, webpages, and random thoughts; We have notebooks for other sites and projects we work on; There are notebooks for upcoming and past holidays; We have timetables, guitar tabs, piano sheet music - all neatly organised and shareable. We'd use Trilium for recipe management, too - except we already have the excellent <a href="https://thecrow.uk/mealie-probably-the-best-self-hosted-recipe-manager-in-the-world/">Mealie self-hosted recipe manager</a>.</p><p>Unlike the 70th Governor of Massachusetts, we do not have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binders_full_of_women" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">binders full of women</a>.</p><h2 id="h-how-to-get-trilium">How to get Trilium</h2><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/trilium-docker-compose-md.webp" alt="Docker Compose file for trilium" width="768" height="288" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/76/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p>If you're planning to use Trilium offline on your local machine, you can grab binaries for Windows, mac, and Linux from the <a href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/trilium/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Trilium releases page</a>. It's fine.</p><p>But running a local only copy of Trilium kind of misses the point. You want to be able to take notes while on the bus, or in the cinema, or while having your moustache curled - and have everything sync automatically.</p><p>To do that, you need a server, ideally running Linux.</p><p>You'll also need to have Docker installed. With that out of the way, you can have Trilium ready to go with a few commands.</p><p>The project Github page lists three different ways of deployiing Trilium: local machine only, available on the local network, or open to the internet.</p><p>In our opinion, the best and simplest way to set up Trilium is to use the local machine docker command to put it onto your server:</p><pre><code>sudo docker run -t -i -p 127.0.0.1:6391:8080 -v ~/trilium/trilium-data:/home/node/trilium-data zadam/trilium:latest</code></pre><p>... and stick it behind a reverse proxy.
