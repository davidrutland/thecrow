You'll see an informative TUI, and the message "No stations to play. Please search for a station first!"</p><p>It's a self-explanatory message, and there are a number of ways to search for stations.</p><p>The easiest way is to use the <strong>--search</strong> or <strong>-S</strong> flagsand enter your radio station by name. For instance, if you have a hankering for BBC Radio 2 you would enter:</p><pre><code>radio -S 'BBC radio 2'</code></pre><p>Radio-active will return a table of radio stations with that name, along with an ID number, broadcast country, and tags. Select a number from the list to start listening. A selection of modern and classic pop hits will instantly fill your ears.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/62/deepvibes-md.webp" alt="Deepvibes RAdio playing on Radio-active" width="768" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/62/responsive/deepvibes-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/62/responsive/deepvibes-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/62/responsive/deepvibes-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/62/responsive/deepvibes-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/62/responsive/deepvibes-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/62/responsive/deepvibes-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Alternatively, you can search by country using <strong>--country</strong> or <strong>-C</strong>, followed by<strong> </strong>your preferred nation's country code. To see a list of streaming stations from the UK, you would enter</p><pre><code>radio -C GB</code></pre><p>Maybe you don't have a particular station or even a country in mind, in which case you can use the <strong>--tag</strong>, or <strong>--language</strong> switches to narrow down your hunt.</p><p>To add a station to your <strong>favourites</strong> list, just hit the <strong>f</strong> key (and pay your respects) while the station is playing.</p><p>Once you've added some favourites, you can view and stream them by starting Radio-active without any arguments, or just view them with:</p><pre><code>radio --list </code></pre><p>If you love what you're listening to, you can record the stream by hitting the <strong>r </strong>key. MP3 files are saved to <strong>~/Music/radioactive</strong>.</p><p>One minor annoyance is that the search table is limited to 100 results. A search for <strong>GB</strong> stations returns an alphabetic list doesn't even make it further than Angel radio. There doesn't seem to be any way of combining search functionality, by which we mean that entering:</p><pre><code>radio --tag classical --country GB</code></pre><p>...will not return a list of UK stations tagged as classical. One of the search criteria will be ignored.</p><p>You can, however, sort the results according to certain factors including <strong>votes</strong>, <strong>bitrate</strong>, <strong>clickcount</strong>, and <strong>random</strong>. For example:</p><p>radio --tag pop --sort votes</p><p>returns a table of the 100 most popular stations tagged as "pop"</p><h2 id="h-radio-active-is-being-actively-developed">Radio-active is being actively developed</h2><p>Radio-active is hands-down the best internet radio TUI we've played with, but it isn't perfect.
