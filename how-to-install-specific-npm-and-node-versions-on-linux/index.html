Here's how to do it.</p><h2 id="h-what-is-node-anyway">What is node anyway?</h2><p>For most people, the daily experience of JavaScript is in a web browser. It's a sort of programming language that allows individual pages to perform complex programmatic functions in a way that simple HTML can't. If the page you're looking at has a form, or any kind of interactive element, the chances are good that it's JavaScript behind the scenes.</p><p>But JavaScript doesn't just run in your browser. It can run on the back-end as well. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a server or even just on your PC. It's great for self-hosted apps that run JavaScript code both on the server-side and the client-side.</p><h2 id="h-why-do-you-need-npm">Why do you need npm?</h2><p>Node Package Manager (npm), as the name suggests, is a package manager for node.js. In simple terms, it's like an app store for JavaScript, where you can find and install reusable pieces of code to use in your ownprojects. npm makes it simple for developers to add functionality to a project by providing access to a vast ecosystem of open source packages created by other people.</p><p>If you're a dedicated self-hoster (as we are), you probably didn't write the code yourself, and are instead installing some awesome web service to play around with and improve your life.</p><p>And for some projects you'll need very specific versions of both node.js and npm.</p><h2 id="h-find-out-what-versions-of-node-and-npm-you-have-installed">Find out what versions of node and npm you have installed</h2><p>If you've installed nope and npm from your distros package manager, the chances are good that what's installed on your system is far behind the most recent versions of npm and node.</p><p>And if you're installing node-based software that was written some time ago, then you'll most likely need to downgrade npm and node in order to prevent problems.</p><p>Consult the project documentation to see what version of node and npm you require, then pop open a terminal, and enter:</p><pre><code>node --version</code></pre><p>then:</p><pre><code>npm -version</code></pre><p>Each command will return the version of the software you have installed.</p><p>As you can see from the screenshot, the node version on this writer's system is <strong>v18.16.0</strong>, while our node package manager is at <strong>9.5.1</strong>.</p><h2 id="h-change-your-nodejs-version-with-n">Change your node.js version with n</h2><p>There is a node package simply called <strong>n</strong>, that you can use to easily install, switch, and manage different versions of Node.js on your system.</p><p>Unfortunately, n doesn't come preinstalled, and it shouldn't come as a surprise that we recommend using npm to install n as well.</p><p>To install n, open a terminal and enter:</p><pre><code>npm install -g n</code></pre><p>With n installed you can change to a rquired node version by adding it as an argument to the n command. For instance, to install and switch to node version 14, you would enter:</p><pre><code>n 14</code></pre><p>It's that simple</p><h2 id="h-use-npm-to-change-npm-version">Use npm to change npm version</h2><p>As npm is both a package manager and a package, you can use npm to install different versions of itself quite easily.</p><p>We're currently on version 9.5.1 of npm, and we want to downgrade to version 6 in order to instal Habitica - a gamified productivity and task management app.</p><p>To change you npm version, open your terminal, and enter:</p><pre><code>npm install -g npm@6.1.0</code></pre><p>In case you're interested, the <strong>g</strong> switch is for "global", and means that npm version 6 will be installed globally on your system, rather than locally within the current directory.</p><p>Now run:</p><pre><code>npm -version</code></pre><p>...to check the current npm version.</p><p>Obviously, you're not going to want to install npm version 6 in every situation, and you should <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm?activeTab=versions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">check available npm versions</a> to see which one you want.</p><h4>Image credit:</h4><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@rahul_saraf?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Rahul Saraf</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-knot-on-a-fence-hlD0k6ALszo?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></p></div></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fhow-to-install-specific-npm-and-node-versions-on-linux%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fhow-to-install-specific-npm-and-node-versions-on-linux%2F&amp;via=The%20Crow&amp;text=How%20to%20install%20specific%20npm%20and%20node%20versions%20on%20Linux" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fhow-to-install-specific-npm-and-node-versions-on-linux%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F79%2Frahul-saraf-hlD0k6ALszo-unsplash.jpg&amp;description=How%20to%20install%20specific%20npm%20and%20node%20versions%20on%20Linux" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Pinterest"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://wa.me/?text=How%20to%20install%20specific%20npm%20and%20node%20versions%20on%20Linux https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fhow-to-install-specific-npm-and-node-versions-on-linux%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Share with WhatsApp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><img class="u-author__avatar" src="https://thecrow.uk/media/website/me.avif" alt="David Rutland" height="false" width="false"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://thecrow.uk/authors/david-rutland/" title="David Rutland">David Rutland</a></h4><p>David is a freelance writer with a background in print journalism, and a love of Free and Open Source Software.
