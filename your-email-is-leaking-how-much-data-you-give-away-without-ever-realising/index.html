They run on their own platforms and despite the obvious similarities they are not interoperable. A Signal user cannot send a kitten pic to a user on Facebook messenger. A Whatsapp user is unable to join a group chat on Telegram. Twitter allows you to interact with other Twitter users and that’s it.</p><p>The Crow communicates by Telegram with Mrs Crow, and Mrs Crow communicates with her sister via WhatsApp. The Crow can’t communicate with Mrs Crow’s sister using instant messaging without using Mrs Crow as a bridge. That’s probably a good thing.</p><p>Email isn’t exclusive or locked in like that. Gmail users can send messages to Yahoo, Hotmail, Tutanota or anyone else. Hell, you can even buy a domain name and set up your own email server on a machine in your house. You’ll be able to use it to communicate with anyone in the world and because it’s your own, there won’t be any pesky Terms of Service limiting what you can use it for. If you’re interested a <a href="https://amzn.to/3omPTEM">Raspberry Pi</a> is perfect for this.</p><p>And if Hotmail or one of the other providers falls over or ceases to function, it won’t take the rest of the email network with it. If you and your buds rely on Twitter or WhatsApp for your comms, you’re at the mercy of that one provider.</p><p>But email, as awesome as it is, leaks more information than you probably realise.</p><h3 id="what-your-email-says-about-you">What your email says about you…</h3><p>The Crow is always very interested to learn more about the people who get in contact with him, and occasionally email provides a window into their lives - or at least their computer setups - than the sender probably realise.</p><p>No, I’m not talking about the username, although if an email arrives from an address containing either ‘420’ or ‘69,’ I will probably make certain assumptions about you.</p><p>The time of day an email arrives can give a clue as to the senders location - I received a mail from a generically named Tutanota account at 3.07am yesterday morning. I believe the sender is in India. I have inferred this from some idiosyncratic phrasing and the probable timezone. I could be wrong.</p><p>But one of the real gold mines in is the metadata.</p><h3 id="what-is-email-metadata">What is email metadata</h3><p>When you open an email, you’ll see what the sender wanted you to see. An amusing picture of a cat, perhaps. There will probably be a written message, and maybe some attached files. That’s all very nice, but most of what is sent over the email network was never meant to be seen by human eyes.</p><p>That’s not to say that it’s hidden, it’s just not prominently on display because, well, to most people it’s irrelevant and confusing.</p><p>Some of it is stuff that your email server needs to know but that you don’t really need to know unless you’re one of those strange people who is interested in how things work. Some of it is included to make sure that it displays correctly when it arrives</p><p>Open up your <a href="https://gmail.com">gmail</a> box - go on, you probably have one. Pretty much everyone does, whether they admit it or not. Even I have one which I check into on a semi-annual basis.</p><p>If you open a message at random and click the three vertical dots, you’ll get a menu. Locate ‘Show Original’ and click on it. A new tab will open, and you’ll see a page of what looks like nonsense.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//gmail_show_original.jpg" alt="Gmail menu highlighting &quot;show original&quot;" width="300" height="513" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/gmail_show_original-xs.jpg 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/gmail_show_original-sm.jpg 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/gmail_show_original-md.jpg 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/gmail_show_original-lg.jpg 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/gmail_show_original-xl.jpg 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/gmail_show_original-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>It isn’t nonsense.</p><h3 id="what-email-metadata-can-tell-you">What email metadata can tell you</h3><p>Here’s a screenshot of some metadata from a friend of mine who works at a property management company:</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//metadata_1.jpg" alt="Email metadata" width="1173" height="142" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/metadata_1-xs.jpg 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/metadata_1-sm.jpg 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/metadata_1-md.jpg 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/metadata_1-lg.jpg 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/metadata_1-xl.jpg 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/metadata_1-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>In it, along with the details of my own mail server (which I have obscured ), I can see the IP address of the office from which it was sent, along with the IP address of the mailserver.</p><p>At the time, that IP address was registered to a small business inclined service provider in the north west of England.</p><p>You can find this out by plugging it into <a href="https://censys.io/ipv4/176.35.102.3">censys.io</a></p><p>You will also notice that it gives the hostname of the PC which sent the message - and the username of the sender.

I have literally no idea. There’s also some information about the font settings on her system, and that she’s using a UK keyboard and spellcheck</p><p>It tells me that they don’t have <a href="https://proprivacy.com/email/guides/what-is-spf">SPF</a> enabled on their email server.

It’s not a read receipt, but it’s good enough.</p><p>This report is generated every time the email is passed on, and sends back ancillary information.</p><p>It’s not unusual for me to send an email to a client, and find out that it was received by an email server run by Zoho, forwarded to an individual who manages their email through Google, and was then shared on Slack.</p><p>That kind of information is valuable and there are all kinds of things you can learn about the relationship between individuals in a company, their relationship to each other and the information cascade between them.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//cascade_analysis.jpg" alt="Email inbox showing dmarc reports" width="497" height="316" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/cascade_analysis-xs.jpg 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/cascade_analysis-sm.jpg 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/cascade_analysis-md.jpg 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/cascade_analysis-lg.jpg 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/cascade_analysis-xl.jpg 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/30//responsive/cascade_analysis-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>In the image above, those six reports were generated from a single email sent by me, which had been passed around other people. Inside them is a date stamp (Unix time) and server information. I can now infer who works from home, who is in charge, who makes decisions, and who gets copied in or consulted.</p><h3 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h3><p>Is there a bottom line? Not really. You can be aware of these things and you can use a service like Tutanota to keep the information to a minimum. You can fake an information cascade between fictitious people with different providers to try and throw off watchers. You can create isolated email accounts and use them only to correspond with certain people and organisations. You can copy and paste text rather than forwarding emails.</p><p>Its up to you how seriously you take it.</p><p>That’s it really.</p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fyour-email-is-leaking-how-much-data-you-give-away-without-ever-realising%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fyour-email-is-leaking-how-much-data-you-give-away-without-ever-realising%2F&amp;via=The%20Crow&amp;text=Your%20email%20is%20leaking%20-%20How%20much%20data%20you%20give%20away%20without%20ever%20realising." class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fyour-email-is-leaking-how-much-data-you-give-away-without-ever-realising%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F30%2Femail_metadata_leaking.jpg&amp;description=Your%20email%20is%20leaking%20-%20How%20much%20data%20you%20give%20away%20without%20ever%20realising." class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Pinterest"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://wa.me/?text=Your%20email%20is%20leaking%20-%20How%20much%20data%20you%20give%20away%20without%20ever%20realising. https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fyour-email-is-leaking-how-much-data-you-give-away-without-ever-realising%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Share with WhatsApp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><img class="u-author__avatar" src="https://thecrow.uk/media/website/me.avif" alt="David Rutland" height="false" width="false"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://thecrow.uk/authors/david-rutland/" title="David Rutland">David Rutland</a></h4><p>David is a freelance writer with a background in print journalism, and a love of Free and Open Source Software.
