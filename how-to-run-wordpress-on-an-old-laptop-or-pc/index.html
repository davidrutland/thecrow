It's super easy to set up, and will run on even basic hardware from more than a decade ago. If you have an old desktop PC or laptop gathering dust in your basement, you can put it to work serving quality content over the internet.</p><h2>Running WordPress on an old computer is easy</h2><p>Before you start, you should read our guide on <a href="https://thecrow.uk/turn-your-old-pc-or-laptop-into-a-server-and-own-your-own-piece-of-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to turn your old PC or laptop into a server</a>. This covers the basics of installing Linux onto your box, and opening the necessary ports on your home router to allow traffic in.</p><p>Once you've done that and have successfully connected to your server over the internet, you may find it easier to connect to your server over SSH from within your own network.</p><p>On your server, open a new terminal window by pressing <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>Alt</strong> + <strong>T</strong>. In the window, type:</p><p><code>sudo apt install openssh-server</code></p><p>Enter your password when requested, and SSH will install.</p><h3>To connect to your server from a Linux PC</h3><p>If you're connecting to your server from a Linux PC, all you need to do is to open a terminal on your local machine and enter:</p><p><code>ssh username@server.local.ip.address</code></p><p>Where <em>username</em> is your username on the server, and <em>server.local.ip.address </em>is, as you might guess, the local IP address of your server.</p><p>To connect to your server from a Windows PC</p><p>Unfortunately, Windows doesn't come with an SSH client built in, so you will need to use a third party client. We recommend PuTTY for SSH connections.</p><p>To use PuTTY on Windows:</p><p>Download the latest version of PuTTY from <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html</a>.</p><p>Double click on the msi installer to start the installation process.</p><p>You can now start PuTTY from your start menu.</p><p>In the hostname field, enter the local IP address of your server, and for <em>User</em>, enter the name you use on your server.</p><p>When you're ready, click <em>Connect</em>.</p><h2>Disconnect your monitor, keyboard, and mouse</h2><p>Now you can connect to your Linux home server through SSH, there's no need to have any peripherals plugged in. You can accidentally input commands or open apps with a keyboard or mouse, and a monitor, even in sleep mode, consumes power.</p><p>You don't need a keyboard, mouse, or monitor to operate your server, so you should unplug them.</p><h2>Install WordPress on your home server</h2><p>After you connect to your home server over SSH, you should upgrade all installed packages:</p><p><code>sudo apt update</code></p><p><code>sudo apt upgrade</code></p><p>Now use wget to fetch the latest release of WordPress to your home directory:</p><p><code>wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip</code></p><p>Before you can unzip the WordPress installation files, you first need to install the <em>unzip</em> utility:</p><p><code>sudo apt install unzip</code></p><p>Now:</p><p><code>unzip latest.zip</code></p><p>A new directory will be created called w<em>ordpress.</em> Use <strong>sudo</strong> to move the new directory to where it is accessible to Apache.</p><p><code>sudo mv -r wordpress /var/www</code></p><p>Change ownership of the WordPress directory so that Apache can read, write, and modify its files:</p><p><code>sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/wordpress</code></p><p>You will need some additional php extensions to correctly set up and use WordPress on your home server. Install them with:</p><p><code>sudo apt install php-curl php-mysql php-dom php-gd php-imagick php-mbstring php-zip php-intl</code></p><h2>Install MariaDB database and create a new user</h2><p>MariaDB is a database and lets your WordPress installation know where all the files and images are. Install it with:</p><p><code>sudo apt install mariadb-server</code></p><p>And set it up with:</p><p><code>sudo mysql_secure_installation</code></p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/mariadb-secue-install-md.webp" alt="MariaDB secure install requesting a root password" width="658" height="176" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/mariadb-secue-install-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/mariadb-secue-install-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/mariadb-secue-install-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/mariadb-secue-install-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/mariadb-secue-install-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/mariadb-secue-install-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Press <strong>return</strong> when prompted to set a root password, and accept the default values for the rest.</p><p>When the process has completed, enter MariaDB with</p><p><code>sudo mariadb</code></p><p>You will be setting up a new user called <strong>wordpress</strong>, and a new database called <strong>wordpress</strong>. Obviously, while we're using "password123" for the purposes of this tutorial, you should use something different.</p><p>Inside mariadb, enter the following lines one at a time, pressing <strong>return</strong> after each one. Ensure that each line ends with a semicolon (;).</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>CREATE DATABASE wordpress;CREATE USER wordpress IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO wordpress@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';GRANT ALL privileges ON wordpress.* TO wordpress@localhost;FLUSH PRIVILEGES;quit;</code></pre><h2>Set up an Apache configuration file for WordPress</h2><p>You should already have Apache installed, so change directory:</p><p><code>cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/</code></p><p>...and use nano to create a new file:</p><p><code>sudo nano wordpress.conf</code></p><p>In this file, paste the following:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>    ServerName your-domain-name.tld    DocumentRoot /var/www/wordpress</code></pre><p>Save and exit nano with <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>O</strong> then <strong>Ctrl </strong>+ <strong>X</strong></p><p>Enable a couple of Apache mods:</p><p><code>sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http</code></p><p>Restart Apache with:</p><p><code>sudo service apache2 restart</code></p><h2>Visit your home Wordpress site in your browser to finish off the initial installation</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/wordpress-installation-wizard-md.webp" alt="Wordpress setup showing database connection detail fields" width="768" height="579" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/wordpress-installation-wizard-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/wordpress-installation-wizard-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/wordpress-installation-wizard-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/wordpress-installation-wizard-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/wordpress-installation-wizard-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/wordpress-installation-wizard-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Open your favourite browser and type "localhost" into the address bar to visit your WordPress installation wizard. You'll be asked to select a language, and you'll need to provide:</p><p><strong>Database name</strong> (wordpress)</p><p><strong>Database username </strong>(wordpress)</p><p><strong>Database password </strong>(password123 or what you set in MariaDB)</p><p><strong>Database host</strong> (localhost)</p><p>When you're done, choose a new username and password.</p><h2>Make secure connections to your home WordPress server</h2><p>Connections to any website are vulnerable to Man in The Middle (MITM) attacks, this is especially problematic when you'll be typing in usernames and passwords.</p><p>Most websites now use Transport Layer Security to encrypt connections. You can use certbot to install security keys and certificates to enable this:</p><p><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot</code></p><p><code>sudo apt update</code></p><p><code>sudo apt-get install python3-certbot-apache</code></p><p>You can now use certbot with:</p><p><code>sudo certbot</code></p><p>Now when you visit your home WordPress site, all connections will be upgraded to HTTPS.</p><h2>You successfully installed and secured a WordPress site on your home server</h2><p>Any old hardware can find a use, especially if you're willing to set aside an afternoon for experimentation, and Linux isn't as scary as you might think.</p><p>Give some thought to the kind of WordPress site you want to run. You can display art, write blog posts, or even use it to start up a new business or side job.</p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fhow-to-run-wordpress-on-an-old-laptop-or-pc%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fhow-to-run-wordpress-on-an-old-laptop-or-pc%2F&amp;via=The%20Crow&amp;text=How%20to%20run%20Wordpress%20on%20an%20old%20laptop%20or%20PC" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fhow-to-run-wordpress-on-an-old-laptop-or-pc%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F44%2Fold_computer_can_be_wordpress_server-2xl.webp&amp;description=How%20to%20run%20Wordpress%20on%20an%20old%20laptop%20or%20PC" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Pinterest"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://wa.me/?text=How%20to%20run%20Wordpress%20on%20an%20old%20laptop%20or%20PC https%3A%2F%2Fthecrow.uk%2Fhow-to-run-wordpress-on-an-old-laptop-or-pc%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Share with WhatsApp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://thecrow.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><img class="u-author__avatar" src="https://thecrow.uk/media/website/me.avif" alt="David Rutland" height="false" width="false"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://thecrow.uk/authors/david-rutland/" title="David Rutland">David Rutland</a></h4><p>David is a freelance writer with a background in print journalism, and a love of Free and Open Source Software.
