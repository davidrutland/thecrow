There's the driving rain, tyres in wet, the distant crash of thunder - all you need is Robby Krieger's relentless guitar, John Densmore's delicate cymbal work, and the smooth pipework of Ray Manzarek's keyboard to nail the vibe.</p><p>We love the song, but we especially love the intro - for us, it's the perfect soundtrack as passengers on long car journeys in the dark. While we can properly engage with Morrison's vocals and lyrics on other occasions, the intro could probably knock us into the land of Nod in under five minutes. The problem is that it's only 45 seconds long.</p><p>We set out to create an enteral <em>Riders</em> intro.</p><p>It's not exact, but its close enough for our purposes.</p><p>We used <strong>yt-dlp</strong> to download <a href="https://linuximpact.com/create-a-multi-textured-ambient-sonic-smorgasbord-with-blanket/#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" rel="nofollow">this 2012 video</a> of Ray Manzarek noodling with his mighty organ at home (snigger), and converted the audio to MP3. We extracted the 6:55 - 8:01(ish) section using Audacity, and exported it as an MP3.</p><p>Back in Blanket, we added the file as a <strong>custom sound</strong>, layered on some rain, and storm, and let rip. It's awesome, and we can listen to it for hours (except we can't because we'd fall asleep).</p><p>We decided against the guitar and cymbals, but may tinker around some more tonight.</p><p>That's what floats our boat, but its different strokes for different, folks.</p><p>You may find you work or sleep better with using the inbuilt honking horns of a city centre and birdsong on a summer night or with the creak of a ship's rigging, and the slap of waves against the hull (This also slaps when overlaid with Manzarek's fingerwork).</p><p>Whether you go with the presets, or import your own (or more accurately, someone else's) sounds from elsewhere, Blanket makes it trivial to adjust the levels, and create an ambient layer that blends into the background with hypnotic effect.</p><p>Image credits:</p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@annapostovaya?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Hanna Postova</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-wearing-blue-top-laying-on-grass-SAYSiIaS6VU?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@callys_corner?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Caleb Williams</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-city-street-at-night-in-the-rain-MFuydBMyjgo?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://thecrow.uk/authors/david-rutland/" title="David Rutland">David Rutland</a></h4><p>David is a freelance writer with a background in print journalism, and a love of Free and Open Source Software.
