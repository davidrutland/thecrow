You don't need to worry - it will just work.</p><p>The project has an impressive array of macOS versions on offer, so if you need a particular software version tied to a specific OS version, or just like the aesthetics, you can choose from (in no particular order) High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, or Ventura.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the project also uses <a href="https://github.com/sickcodes/osx-serial-generator">OSX Serial Generator</a> - another project from Sick Codes - that generates valid OSX serial numbers, allowing you use to iMessage on your virtual Mac.</p><h2 id="h-get-a-virtual-mac-on-linux-in-minutes">Get a virtual mac on Linux in minutes</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/60/designecologist-Pmh0UoG1vlE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Apple mac on a pink lit desk" width="1920" height="1280" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/60/responsive/designecologist-Pmh0UoG1vlE-unsplash-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/60/responsive/designecologist-Pmh0UoG1vlE-unsplash-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/60/responsive/designecologist-Pmh0UoG1vlE-unsplash-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/60/responsive/designecologist-Pmh0UoG1vlE-unsplash-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/60/responsive/designecologist-Pmh0UoG1vlE-unsplash-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/60/responsive/designecologist-Pmh0UoG1vlE-unsplash-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Well, minutes might be a tiny bit misleading unless you have an insanely fast internet connection and the stars are aligned in a certain way.

You can press this or wait 30 seconds for setup to continue. Another minute and you'll be on the macOS utilities menu. Click on <strong>DIsk Utility</strong>, and find the the disk with the highest capacity. Click <strong>Erase</strong>, then give a name to the disk that will take its place. "Mydisk" is good if you're searching for inspiration. Leave the <strong>Format</strong> and <strong>Scheme</strong> with their default values. Click <strong>Erase</strong> when you're happy, then the big blue <strong>Done</strong> button when it's done. When you return to the <strong>Disk Utility</strong> menu, you should see your new disk name listed on the left.</p><p>With that out of the way, leave the Disk Utility, and then press on <strong>Reinstall macOS</strong>. Go through the prompts, and you're done. Welcome to the macOS life!</p><p>For Big Sur, the command is:</p><pre><code>docker run -it \

It's dull, and you have better things to do with your time.</p><p>If you want to swerve the chore of clicking through screens, theeasiest way to get your Virtual Mac up and running is to use the pre-installed Catalina image. It's completely hands-off, but it isn't the quickest. The Download itself is in excess of 20GB, and you'll need at least 40GB free on your host machine.</p><p>If you want to go with this option, pop open a terminal, and enter:</p><pre><code>docker run -it \
