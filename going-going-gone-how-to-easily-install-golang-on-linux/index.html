Want to install Go on your Linux system? This is how.</p><h2 id="h-why-install-go-on-linux">Why install Go on Linux?</h2><p>If you're a coder, you probably want to install Go on Linux because you want a high-level programming language that's powerful and not too difficult to learn and use. It can help you to get a job within the IT field, pivot to a new direction, or you can use it to create hobby projects to either showcase your skills or just for giggles.</p><p>But we suspect (we have no proof of this), that most people would need to install Go on Linux in order to install and use some of the awesome open-source projects, tools, and games that are created with Go, and require Go to run.</p><p>If this is you, read on...</p><h2 id="h-installing-go-on-linux-is-easy">Installing Go on Linux is easy.</h2><p>Go - or Golang as it's present in most of the major repositories, which means that you can install it using your package manager in the usual way.</p><p>If you're on Ubuntu, for instance, you would open a terminal and enter:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install golang-go</code></pre><p>For systems with snap, enter:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">sudo snap install go --classic</code></pre><p>Go is also available in the Arch User Repository.</p><p>But repositories have an unfortunate tendency to lag far behind the latest release of any software package, and Go is no exception. If you want the most up-to-date version of go, you're better off installing it yourself - although this does mean that Go won't update when you update the rest of your system</p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/86/golang_wget-md.webp" alt="using wget to download the golang tarball" width="768" height="273" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/86/responsive/golang_wget-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/86/responsive/golang_wget-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/86/responsive/golang_wget-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/86/responsive/golang_wget-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/86/responsive/golang_wget-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/86/responsive/golang_wget-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p>To grab the latest version of Go, visit <a href="https://go.dev/dl/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://go.dev/dl/</a> and look for your OS and architecture in the list. Your OS is, obviously, Linux, and if you're running it on a modern PC the architecture should be x86-64. If you're installing on a machine with an ARM processor, such as a Raspberry Pi, a repurposed modern mac, or similar, you need ARM64. Sorry, 32-bit Pi users, you appear to be out of luck.</p><p>Right-click on the tarball name and copy the address to your clipboard, then open a terminal and use <strong>wget</strong> to download the package to your current directory. For instance:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz</code></pre><p>When the download has completed, extract it to <strong>/usr/local/</strong> with the following command:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf go1.22.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz</code></pre><p>Make sure you change the filename to match the version you downloaded.</p><p>Go is now installed in /usr/local/go/bin, but your system won't know where to find it if you type the command <strong>go</strong> into your terminal, and you'll see a "command not found" message. To fix this enter the following lines:</p><pre><code>echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" &gt;&gt; .profile</code></pre><p>...and refresh your profile:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">source ~/.profile </code></pre><p>That's it Go is now installed on your Linux server or PC.
