Not so much.</p><p>So it should be no surprise that we run to online grammar checking tools several times per day, to make sure that we're not imperilling our livelihood with an excess of em dashes.</p><p>Maybe you're not a huge fan of cloud-based grammar checkers, preferring instead to run software locally. Maybe you're just fed up with being nagged to hand over your email, address, create and account, or sign in with Google.</p><p>LanguageTool is a full-featured Open Source tool you can run on your own machine or network to keep your sentences clean, and mind your Ps and Qs.</p><h2 id="h-whats-wrong-with-grammarly">What's wrong with Grammarly?</h2><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/grammarly_screenshot-md.webp" alt="Screenshot of the grammarly homepage" width="768" height="414" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/grammarly_screenshot-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/grammarly_screenshot-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/grammarly_screenshot-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/grammarly_screenshot-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/grammarly_screenshot-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/grammarly_screenshot-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p>Grammarly is probably the best-known name in the grammar-checking world, and is used by writers, editors, students, and probably teachers across the world. People use it before sending emails, submitting essays, and while drafting correctly formatted love poetry to their crush or life partner.</p><p>The biggest problem we have with Grammarly is that you need an account to use it. Sure, it's free to sign up, and you can even sign in with Google, but signing up to online services is anathema to use here at The Crow. We live in dread that the various services we <em>do</em> have accounts with will inevitably be hacked.</p><p>You'll also have to agree to the Grammarly Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the company swears that, "we don’t and will not sell your data," we're naturally mistrustful of such pledges.</p><p>According to Grammarly users of our acquaintance (we've never tried it ourselves), the service has severe limitations for free users, and is heavy-handed in its attempts to upsell users on the premium plan.</p><p>There's also the fact that the analysis takes place in the cloud, on someone else's machine.</p><p>Maybe you want the extra privacy afforded by running your erotic literary masterpiece through software on your own premises,</p><h2 id="h-languagetool-is-a-pretty-decent-grammarly-alternative">LanguageTool is a pretty decent Grammarly alternative</h2><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/languagetool-web-interface-md.webp" alt="Screenshot of the grammarly homepage" width="768" height="337" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/languagetool-web-interface-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/languagetool-web-interface-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/languagetool-web-interface-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/languagetool-web-interface-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/languagetool-web-interface-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/81/responsive/languagetool-web-interface-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p><a href="https://languagetool.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">LanguageTool</a> is another online service that its developers describe as, "an AI-based spelling, style, and grammar checker that helps correct or paraphrase texts across languages."</p><p>For the purposes of this article, we visited the site to try it out.

Some of these are bullshit that we don't care about, such as using hyphens instead of em dashes. You can accept the suggestions, ignore them, or disable a particular error class altogether.</p><p>It's also possible to copy and paste entire screeds into a dedicated LanguageTool Editor in order to check it in a flat environment. To open the LanguageTool editor, click on the extension icon, then <strong>Open Editor</strong>.</p><p>One of the advantages of using the self-hosted version of LanguageTool rather than the version hosted by the company is that there's no limit on word count - we were able to paste in and check the entirety of Cory Doctorow's excellent <a href="https://amzn.to/3TI731H" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Eastern Standard Tribe</a>.
