It was created in the early 1970s as a way of engaging pre-adolescent schoolchildren with the harsh realities of life on the pioneer route from the misery of Missouri to the promised land on what would later become the US east coast.</p><p>The game mechanics are simple. It's essentially a mix of lightweight management sim, and a series of minigames you play to keep your party alive through random and fixed events as you travel between objectives on a map.</p><p>Starting in the town of Independence, you pick your party members, buy a wagon and supplies, then set off on your journey westward.</p><p>You'll choose what route to take, and need to make decisions on how to survive. Clean shirts, medicine, and harmonicas will keep the party hygienic, healthy, and happy but take up space in the wagon. They'll also disappear as they're used, and become damaged as your wagon cover decays. Wagon repair kits are in short supply once you hit the trail, but can be bartered for at major landmarks and forts.</p><p>While you start off with some basic foodstuffs, you'll need to kill to survive once you're away from civilization: hunting requires bullets (and a knife if you want to keep the pelts); fishing requires bait. The result is a bunch of fun minigames that serve to keep you alive, while providing tradeable resources. There are other random encounters and minigames, too, but we'll leave them as a surprise.</p><h2>Pixels and parallax on the Oregon trail</h2><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/93/oregon_trail_blue_mountains-md.webp" alt="Oregon Trail party with four member heading uphill into snow.

Or a Wagon. Or a bird.</p><p>The most recent iteration of the game acknowledges this heritage with a distinctly pixel-art style, and sprite animation that you think you remember from the 1990s, but which is actually much, much, better.</p><p>The trail moves beneath your feet, with the characters and their wagon staying more-or-less centre screen, but you can really get a sense of distance travelled thanks to parallax scrolling - meaning that the background, middle, and foreground move at a different rate.</p><p>For a pixel art style retro gaming experience, this is perfect, and harks back the late 1990s and the days of the Amiga 1200 (for which The Oregon Trail was never released).</p><p>Minigames are simple and fun, and with the kind of no-clip action you'd expect from pre-millenium platforms.</p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/93/hunting_in_oregon_trail-md.webp" alt="A lone hunter standing in a snowy clearing with a rifle in her hands.

In addition to a variety of trails and seasons you can traverse as the ever-marching face of expansion, you'll also get to play as the people who were originally there. On Winter Migration trail, for instance, you'll take the role of a Native American mother and son, who must reach the hunting grounds before winter sets in. Unlike the main game, you won't have a wagon, and consequentially, very little room for provisions.</p><p>This isn't the only nod to the diversity of people populating the old west. While your party may be composed of racially diverse characters, Conversations with NPCs will tell you that Black people won't be permitted to settle in Oregon. May as well stay at home. Right?</p><h2>The Linux Trail</h2><p>Similar to the Oregon Trail itself, getting to Oregon on Linux isn't quite as simple as hopping on a train or plane to your destination.</p><p>Despite the many platforms for which the game has been published over the past half-century, it has never been officially made available for Linux.</p><p>This doesn't mean it's difficult to install or run, though. Gameloft's The Oregon Trail is available on Steam or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_oregon_trail" data-md-href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_oregon_trail" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">DRM-free on Gog</a> for £24.99.</p><p>In the former case, you'll be able to use Steam's Proton to play the game, and in the latter case, we installed and launched with the Heroic Games launcher for flawless performance.</p><p>£25 is a high price for a game that's changed little over the past 50 years, but there's a huge amount of additional content, and even the main trail will keep you occupied for more than a day.</p><h2>There are games even older than The Oregon Trail</h2><p>If the Oregon trail has you yearning for the simpler gaming experience of years gone by, but you don't have a time machine (or an emulator) to hand, you can try out Colossal Cave Adventure - the first text adventure game ever made.</p></div></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://thecrow.uk/authors/david-rutland/" title="David Rutland">David Rutland</a></h4><p>David is a freelance writer with a background in print journalism, and a love of Free and Open Source Software.
