You don't need to chase down dependencies, and you can port your dockerized app from system to system. Often, rolling out a Docker app is as simple as entering a single line specifying the image, volumes, and ports to use.</p><p>Docker Compose makes life even simpler, and you can use it to lay out your parameters in a single YAML file, and control your containers with an even shorter command.</p><h2 id="h-some-projects-dont-come-with-docker-compose">Some projects don't come with Docker Compose</h2><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/66/sad-baby-md.webp" alt="A sad baby on a picnic blanket" width="768" height="384" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/66/responsive/sad-baby-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/66/responsive/sad-baby-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/66/responsive/sad-baby-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/66/responsive/sad-baby-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/66/responsive/sad-baby-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/66/responsive/sad-baby-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Docker Compose is our preferred way of administering the dozens of dockerised apps we use on a daily basis. It's even easier than Docker, and comes with the added bonus that you can manage multiple docker containers simultaneously. Forget typing in lengthy Docker commands - it's all right there in your <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong>.</p><p>It's nice when open source projects come with ready made Docker Compose files, but even if they don't you can quickly create your own using docker-autocompose - a Python project that inspects the configurations of containers, and generates the necessary config - provided you already have your Docker container running, that is.</p><h2 id="h-docker-autocompose-is-easy-to-install">docker-autocompose is easy to install</h2><p>Before you start, you should make sure you have both <a href="https://thecrow.uk/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-docker-compose-on-linux-and-why-you-should/">Docker and Docker Compose</a> on your system.</p><p>docker-autocompose is a Python app, so you should also have Python3 and Pip.

It's a fantastic and free alternative to Evernote or OneNote that you can use without any restrictions or fees. Trilium is also massively extensible with themes, widgets, scripts, and API extensions available.</p><p>While the Trilium developers have created a dockerised version of the notes server for easy deployment, they haven't created a Docker Compose file for easy management. Drat - but we can fix that.</p><p>First deploy the Trilium Docker container in something approximating the recommended way:</p><pre><code>mkdir trilium &amp;&amp; cd trilium</code></pre><pre><code>sudo docker run -t -i -p 127.0.0.1:6391:8080 -v ~/trilium/trilium-data:/home/node/trilium-data zadam/trilium:latest</code></pre><p>Note that we've specified port 6391 as our external port - that's simply because we already have something running on port 8080. You can also change the location where you want Trilium to keep its data. We've created a Trilium directory and specified the data directory should go in there.</p><p>Later, it's where our Trilium <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong> file will reside. Hit <strong>enter</strong> and Docker will download the Trilium images and set up the necessary containers and data directory.</p><p>Visit localhost:6391 to check Trilium is running, then in another terminal tab or window, enter:</p><pre data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><code>docker ps</code></pre><p>This command will give you information on all of the docker containers running on your system.
