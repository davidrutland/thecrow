The Crow is running i3-wm on top of the latest iteration of Pop OS 22.04. Surely, installing Scrivener can’t be as easy as downloading a .deb file and running dpkg?</p><p>It isn’t. Most of the libraries and dependencies Scrivener needs to run are also obsolete, they’re difficult to find and there are big holes in the Ubuntu archive where packages have disappeared without a trace. According to <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/scrivener-now-linux">comments left on an ancient Linux Journal article</a>, the Scrivener installation was frustrating future fictioneers at least as far back as Ubuntu 14.04.</p><p>After an afternoon of dead-ends, broken links, absent archives, forgotten files, and general frustration, I actually managed to get it up and running.</p><p>Unlike the Windows and Mac versions of Scrivener, the Linux Beta is completely free of charge, and if you follow these meandering instructions, you can be tapping out the next New York Times bestseller in a matter of minutes.</p><p>It’s simpler than you think, so pop open a terminal, and we’ll start installing the dependencies.</p><p>The first thing you should know is that you’re actually going to be compiling one package from source - purely because there isn’t an up-to-date ready built deb available at the time of writing (or at least I couldn’t find one). It’s nothing to worry about, but you need to make sure you have the right tools to do it first.</p><blockquote><p>sudo apt-get install libtool autoconf build-essential pkg-config automake tcsh zlib1g-dev</p></blockquote><p>Create a new temporary directory and cd into it, then:</p><blockquote><p>wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/libp/libpng/libpng_1.2.54.orig.tar.xz</p></blockquote><p>and when archive has downloaded, enter these commands in sequence:</p><blockquote><p>tar xvf libpng_1.2.54.orig.tar.xz</p><p>cd libpng-1.2.54/</p><p>./autogen.sh</p><p>./configure</p><p>make -j8</p><p>sudo make install</p><p>sudo ldconfig</p></blockquote><p>Great. If everything went smoothly, you will no longer get the <em>‘libpng12.so.0: cannot open shared object file:’</em> error when you try to launch scrivener.</p><p>You only need a few more packages, so</p><blockquote><p><del>wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/glibc/multiarch-support_2.19-18+deb8u10_amd64.deb</del></p><p>wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/glibc/multiarch-support_2.28-10+deb10u1_amd64.deb</p><p>wget http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gstreamer0.10/libgstreamer0.10-0_0.10.36-1.5ubuntu1_amd64.deb</p><p>wget https://ftp.lysator.liu.se/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gst-plugins-base0.10/libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0_0.10.36-1.1ubuntu2.1_amd64.deb</p></blockquote><p>Install the deb files you just downloaded with:</p><blockquote><p><del>sudo dpkg -i multiarch-support_2.19-18+deb8u10_amd64.deb</del></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>sudo dpkg -i multiarch-support_2.28-10+deb10u1_amd64.deb</p><p>sudo dpkg -i libgstreamer0.10-0_0.10.36-1.5ubuntu1_amd64.deb</p><p>sudo dpkg -i libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0_0.10.36-1.1ubuntu2.1_amd64.deb</p></blockquote><p>Again, everything <em>should</em> be going smoothly at this point.</p><p>Grab the Linux Scrivener Beta deb and then install:</p><blockquote><p>wget http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivenerforlinux/scrivener-1.9.0.1-amd64.deb</p><p>sudo dpkg -i scrivener-1.9.0.1-amd64.deb</p></blockquote><p>And that’s it. Launch by typing <em>scrivener</em> into the terminal, or with drun / rofi. If you’re the type of person who indulges in full desktop environments, icons, and other such frivolities, you can follow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200202054452/https://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=20489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these archived instructions from 2012.</a> Ignore the first part of the instructions (they no longer work), and pick up from:</p><blockquote><p>which Scrivener</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id="how-does-the-2011-scrivener-beta-run-on-ubuntu-2204">How does the 2011 Scrivener Beta run on Ubuntu 22.04</h3><p>Great! It’s difficult to believe that this is a long-abandoned beta version. Seriously - it’s a quality product.</p><p>Launch it by whatever method you choose and you’re greeted with a <em>Getting Started</em> window - giving you the option to choose from four disfferent types of writing setups: Blank, Fiction, Non-fiction, scriptwriting, and Miscellaneous.</p><p>There are huge differences between these - after all, while the essence of any piece of writing is to get words onto a page, and it’s <em>you</em> who has to put them there, it’s a good idea to provide a correctly formatted work to the intern who decides whether to toss your script in the trash.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/41/scrivener_getting_started-2.jpg" alt="Scrivener launcher on Linux desktop" width="1920" height="1080" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/41/responsive/scrivener_getting_started-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/41/responsive/scrivener_getting_started-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/41/responsive/scrivener_getting_started-2-md.jpg 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/41/responsive/scrivener_getting_started-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/41/responsive/scrivener_getting_started-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/41/responsive/scrivener_getting_started-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>Blank gives you a blank and empty project, but the others provide a range of different templates which may or may not suit what you’re doing. From within <em>scriptwriting</em>, for instance, you can choose from BBC format for radio; BBC format for taped drama series; A comic script template provided by graphic novel and comics writer Antony Johnston; A template project set up for writing Hollywood screenplays ready for printing directly or exporting to Final Draft; The title page, compile settings and structure for creating both UK and US stage play manuscripts.</p><p>I mean, holy shit.
