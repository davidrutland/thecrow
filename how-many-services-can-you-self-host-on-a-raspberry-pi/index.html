It's easy to get answers to questions you never knew you had.</p><p>Another reason is the Pi's very low power draw. Our principle Pi - an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16G7DHNEVDVBH&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+8gb&amp;qid=1699266630&amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+8gb%252Caps%252C152&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=0f9dee46e8b8e6c27a2421c530833bac&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">8GB Raspberry Pi model 4B</a> - pulls under 10 Watts. Remember when your mum used to yell at you for leaving the lights on in your home? The Pi pulls less than a single modern LED lightbulb. It takes one sixth to one tenth of the power of the kind of yellowish incandescent light bulb we grew up with.</p><p>That's important. A server is on 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. While you can easily repurpose an old PC or laptop as a server, any savings you make by not buying a Pi are dwarfed by the electricity bills over the course of a year.</p><p>Lastly, the Pi can handle pretty much anything you can throw at it on the level of a family unit or smallish organisation (the exception being generative AI, which it handles very slowly indeed).</p><p>Writing this paragraph, we don't actually <em>know</em> what we have running on the Linux Impact Raspberry Pi. We decided to take a look, and share the results.</p><h2 id="h-how-our-raspberry-pi-is-set-up">How our Raspberry Pi is set up</h2><p>Our Pi is connected to the router via Gigabit internet.

In addition to the Pi's 8GB RAM, we have 8GB swap. Just in case.</p><p>We haven't overclocked our Pi, because we value stability over speed. Besides, we haven't had the need - yet.</p><p>Base software-wise, we're running a fairly standard LAMP stack based on Debian Bullseye in its guise of Raspberry Pi OS. We're using <a href="https://thecrow.uk/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-docker-compose-on-linux-and-why-you-should/">Docker and Docker Compose</a> to manage a portion of our services.</p><p>Without further ado, let's dive into <strong>/etc/apache2/sites-available/</strong> and see what we have exposed to the web:</p><h2 id="h-nextcloud">Nextcloud</h2><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/nextcloud_logo.jpg" alt="Blue nextcloud logo on a white background" width="1600" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p>Nextcloud is the first thing we installed when we started our self-hosted journey some years ago. NextCloud can replace almost every web service out there.</p><p>Forked from OwnCloud, Nextcloud is a Dropbox / Google Drive replacement at its core and helps you synchronise your files and folders across all your devices. But its marketplace of apps, add-ons and extensions makes it so much more than that.</p><p>There's a webmail client, an excellent markdown notes app, recipe manager, Fediverse server and client, spreed-based video conferencing and instant messaging, photo gallery, and a full-fat collaborative office suite courtesy of Collabora Online.</p><p>There's more - a lot more - but we don't have space for it.

Unlike traditional RSS readers such as the excellent QuiteRSS, FreshRSS makes it easy to fetch the full text of an article instead of just the excerpt. It's all stored on the Raspberry Pi, and we can favourite the best articles for later.</p><p>We use Fluent Reader Lite on Android to interact with our FreshRSS instance while we're waiting in the queue at Lidl. Nextcloud News offers similar functionality, but it isn't quite so granular in helping us get exactly what we want.</p><p>FYI: Linux impact offers a full-text RSS feed with no tricks required. You should subscribe.</p><h2 id="h-mealie"><a href="https://thecrow.uk/mealie-probably-the-best-self-hosted-recipe-manager-in-the-world/">Mealie</a></h2><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/mealie-md-2.webp" alt="Mealie web interface showing a recipe for tarte tatin" width="768" height="378" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/mealie-md-2-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/mealie-md-2-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/mealie-md-2-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/mealie-md-2-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/mealie-md-2-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/mealie-md-2-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p>Cooking is a joy, and collecting recipes without reading through the author's life history appeals to our acquisative tendencies.</p><p>Mealie helps you keep your culinary favourites in one place, and easy to sort, categorise and search.

It's not so much that we object to seeing goods and services advertised on our various devices - it's that they try to track us around the internet. No-one needs to see our complete browser history, but ad networks would - if they could.</p><p>In addition to the excellent UBlock Origin or Firefox, we have Pi-hole deployed on our Raspberry Pi. Pi-hole sits between the wider internet, and every machine on our home network.</p><p>Any request to a domain associated with tracking is told to fetch assets from <strong>0.0.0.0</strong> - an IP address that doesn't exist.

It's great for writing a quick note to yourself, or for to-do lists. Memos supports Markdown, checkboxes, and tags. There's also a handy activity indicator, giving a clue as to how many memos we wrote over a given time period (154 memos in 167 days). We could use it to create shopping lists, but we use Mealie for that.</p><p>Again, Memos has a solid mobile app for passing thoughts while we're waiting in traffic.</p><h2 id="h-immich"><a href="https://thecrow.uk/immich-is-the-killer-app-that-will-kick-start-the-self-hosting-revolution/">Immich</a></h2><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md.webp" alt="Immich web interface showing images and on this day for various years" width="768" height="386" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p>Immich is one of the heavyweights, and we're convinced that it's the killer app that can persuade normal people into self-hosting.</p><p>Immich is essentially a Google Photos clone.
