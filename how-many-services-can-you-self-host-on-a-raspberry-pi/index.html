It's easy to get answers to questions you never knew you had.</p><p>Another reason is the Pi's very low power draw. Our principle Pi - an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16G7DHNEVDVBH&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+8gb&amp;qid=1699266630&amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+8gb%252Caps%252C152&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=0f9dee46e8b8e6c27a2421c530833bac&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">8GB Raspberry Pi model 4B</a> - pulls under 10 Watts. Remember when your mum used to yell at you for leaving the lights on in your home? The Pi pulls less than a single modern LED lightbulb. It takes one sixth to one tenth of the power of the kind of yellowish incandescent light bulb we grew up with.</p><p>That's important. A server is on 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. While you can easily repurpose an old PC or laptop as a server, any savings you make by not buying a Pi are dwarfed by the electricity bills over the course of a year.</p><p>Lastly, the Pi can handle pretty much anything you can throw at it on the level of a family unit or smallish organisation (the exception being generative AI, which it handles very slowly indeed).</p><p>Writing this paragraph, we don't actually <em>know</em> what we have running on the Linux Impact Raspberry Pi. We decided to take a look, and share the results.</p><h2 id="h-how-our-raspberry-pi-is-set-up">How our Raspberry Pi is set up</h2><p>Our Pi is connected to the router via Gigabit internet. To keep it from getting too hot, we have a cast aluminium passive cooling system.

In addition to the Pi's 8GB RAM, we have 8GB swap. Just in case.</p><p>We haven't overclocked our Pi, because we value stability over speed. Besides, we haven't had the need - yet.</p><p>Base software-wise, we're running a fairly standard LAMP stack based on Debian Bullseye in its guise of Raspberry Pi OS. We're using <a href="https://thecrow.uk/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-docker-compose-on-linux-and-why-you-should/">Docker and Docker Compose</a> to manage a portion of our services.</p><p>Without further ado, let's dive into <strong>/etc/apache2/sites-available/</strong> and see what we have exposed to the web:</p><h2 id="h-nextcloud">Nextcloud</h2><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/nextcloud_logo.jpg" alt="Blue nextcloud logo on a white background" width="1600" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-xs.jpg 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-sm.jpg 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-md.jpg 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-lg.jpg 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-xl.jpg 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/67/responsive/nextcloud_logo-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p>Nextcloud is the first thing we installed when we started our self-hosted journey some years ago. NextCloud can replace almost every web service out there.</p><p>Forked from OwnCloud, Nextcloud is a Dropbox / Google Drive replacement at its core and helps you synchronise your files and folders across all your devices. But its marketplace of apps, add-ons and extensions makes it so much more than that.</p><p>There's a webmail client, an excellent markdown notes app, recipe manager, Fediverse server and client, spreed-based video conferencing and instant messaging, photo gallery, and a full-fat collaborative office suite courtesy of Collabora Online.</p><p>There's more - a lot more - but we don't have space for it. You can check out the full range of apps at <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://apps.nextcloud.com/</a></p><p>Honestly, you could live your self-hosted life without ever using another FAANG company again.</p><p>But while Nextcloud has offerings for pretty much everything, there are other projects dedicated to specific goals that are more polished and tighter focused.
