Just make sure you have curl installed:</p><pre><code>sudo apt install curl</code></pre><p>...then use curl to download the script and pipe it to bash:</p><pre><code> curl -o- -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statping-ng/statping-ng/stable/install.sh | bash </code></pre><p>We prefer to use a dockerised solution, as it gives us more control. Either way is good, but if you prefer to follow our example, make sure you have <a href="https://thecrow.uk/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-docker-compose-on-linux-and-why-you-should/" target="null">Docker and Docker Compose installed</a>, then create a new directory within your home directory, and use the <strong>cd</strong> command to move into it:</p><pre><code>mkdir statping-ng &amp;&amp; cd statping-ng</code></pre><p>Use the <strong>nano</strong> text editor to create a new file for Docker compose:</p><pre><code>nano docker-compose.yml</code></pre><p>In it, paste the following:</p><pre><code>version: '2.3'

services:
  statping:
    container_name: statping
    image: adamboutcher/statping-ng:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - statping_data:/app
    environment:
      DB_CONN: sqlite
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

volumes:
  statping_data:</code></pre><p>If you're running other services on port 8080, make sure you change the port number.</p><p>Save and exit nano with <strong>Ctrl + O</strong> then <strong>Ctrl + X</strong>.</p><p>The following command will download the relevant images and set up containers for statping-ng:</p><pre><code>docker-compose up -d</code></pre><p>Now visit your statping-ng instance at your.server.ip.address:8080/login</p><p>Log in with the username <strong>admin</strong>, and the password <strong>admin</strong>, then go to <strong>Users</strong> and change these credentials to something more secure.</p><p>You'll want to access statping-ng over the internet, so head over to your registrar and create a new domain or subdomain. Set the value as your server or home IP address and the TTL as low as possible.</p><p>Back on your server, make sure you have the necessary Apache mods enabled:</p><pre><code>sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http rewrite</code></pre><p>Create a new config file for Apache:</p><pre><code>cd /etc/apache2/sites/available
sudo nano statping-ng.conf</code></pre><p>In the new file, paste the following:</p><pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
ServerName your-domain.tld
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
ProxyPassReverse / http:/127.0.0.1:8080/
ProxyPreserveHost On
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></pre><p>Save and exit nano with <strong>Ctrl + O</strong> then <strong>Ctrl + X</strong></p><p>Enable the site, and restart Apache with:</p><pre><code>sudo a2ensite statping-ng.conf
sudo service apache2 restart</code></pre><p>At this point, you should be able to reach your statping-ng instance, by typing the address into the URL bar of your browser, but because you're connecting over <strong>HTTP</strong> rather than <strong>HTTPS</strong>, you're vulnerable to man in the middle attacks.</p><p>Certbot is an easy-to-use tool you can deploy to manage your TLS keys, certificates, and encryption. If you don't already have it on your server, install it now by entering:</p><pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot</code></pre><p>Run Certbot to fetch new certificates and keys:</p><pre><code>sudo certbot</code></pre><p>Follow the prompts, and select your statping-ng domain name from a list. Choose to automatically updrage all connections, and when you're returned to the prompt, restart Apache once more with:</p><pre><code>sudo service apache2 restart</code></pre><p>That's it. Statping-ng is installed, secured, and you can access it via your domain name over HTTPS!</p><h2 id="h-set-up-statping-ng-as-a-self-hosted-status-page-for-all-your-sites-and-services">Set up statping-ng as a self-hosted status page for all your sites and services!</h2><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/77/the-crow-latency-md.webp" alt="Statping web interface showing The Crow latency" width="768" height="382" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/77/responsive/the-crow-latency-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/77/responsive/the-crow-latency-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/77/responsive/the-crow-latency-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/77/responsive/the-crow-latency-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/77/responsive/the-crow-latency-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/77/responsive/the-crow-latency-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p>Type your domain name into the URL bar of any browser and you'll be greeted with the Title, "Statping Sample Data", and the revelation that, "This status page has sample data included".</p><p>The sample data contains uptime stats for sites including GitHub, Google, and some API endpoints.

Don't worry, you can leave most of these as they are. You'll need to give your service a name, and choose whether it's HTTP, TCP, UDP, gRPC, static, or if you just want an IMCP ping. A permalink URL means you can go directly to the status page of a service, so make it short and sweet. You'll find the page at <strong>your-domain.tld/service/permalink-name</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Public Service</strong> toggle is self explanatory, and you'll need to specify a <strong>Check Interval</strong>. This is how often you want statping-ng to check if your service is still alive - 60 seconds is good in our opinion.</p><p><strong>Service Endpoint</strong> is the URL you want to query - in most cases this will simply be the domain name or subdomain of your service, and by default the type will be a simple GET request. You can change this in the drop-down, and additionally select from POST, DELETE, PATCH, or PUT.</p><p>Below this, you can specify the expected response and status codes. The default is 200, but again, you can set this whatever you want.</p><p>Lastly, you'll want to tailor your notifications.

In addition to the notifications, you also have graphs and details at your fingertips, and you can easily add new services to monitor while you're out and about. The app is free <em>but, </em>if you want the in-app notifications you'll need to "become pro" through a one-time in-app purchase. The pro model also gets you a dark theme, which is nice.</p><p>We opted for using the free tier statping app, plus notifications via email.
