Just make sure you have curl installed:</p><pre><code>sudo apt install curl</code></pre><p>...then use curl to download the script and pipe it to bash:</p><pre><code> curl -o- -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statping-ng/statping-ng/stable/install.sh | bash </code></pre><p>We prefer to use a dockerised solution, as it gives us more control. Either way is good, but if you prefer to follow our example, make sure you have <a href="https://thecrow.uk/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-docker-compose-on-linux-and-why-you-should/" target="null">Docker and Docker Compose installed</a>, then create a new directory within your home directory, and use the <strong>cd</strong> command to move into it:</p><pre><code>mkdir statping-ng &amp;&amp; cd statping-ng</code></pre><p>Use the <strong>nano</strong> text editor to create a new file for Docker compose:</p><pre><code>nano docker-compose.yml</code></pre><p>In it, paste the following:</p><pre><code>version: '2.3'

services:
  statping:
    container_name: statping
    image: adamboutcher/statping-ng:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:

    environment:
      DB_CONN: sqlite
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

volumes:
  statping_data:</code></pre><p>If you're running other services on port 8080, make sure you change the port number.</p><p>Save and exit nano with <strong>Ctrl + O</strong> then <strong>Ctrl + X</strong>.</p><p>The following command will download the relevant images and set up containers for statping-ng:</p><pre><code>docker-compose up -d</code></pre><p>Now visit your statping-ng instance at your.server.ip.address:8080/login</p><p>Log in with the username <strong>admin</strong>, and the password <strong>admin</strong>, then go to <strong>Users</strong> and change these credentials to something more secure.</p><p>You'll want to access statping-ng over the internet, so head over to your registrar and create a new domain or subdomain. Set the value as your server or home IP address and the TTL as low as possible.</p><p>Back on your server, make sure you have the necessary Apache mods enabled:</p><pre><code>sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http rewrite</code></pre><p>Create a new config file for Apache:</p><pre><code>cd /etc/apache2/sites/available
sudo nano statping-ng.conf</code></pre><p>In the new file, paste the following:</p><pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
ServerName your-domain.tld
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
ProxyPassReverse / http:/127.0.0.1:8080/
ProxyPreserveHost On
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></pre><p>Save and exit nano with <strong>Ctrl + O</strong> then <strong>Ctrl + X</strong></p><p>Enable the site, and restart Apache with:</p><pre><code>sudo a2ensite statping-ng.conf
sudo service apache2 restart</code></pre><p>At this point, you should be able to reach your statping-ng instance, by typing the address into the URL bar of your browser, but because you're connecting over <strong>HTTP</strong> rather than <strong>HTTPS</strong>, you're vulnerable to man in the middle attacks.</p><p>Certbot is an easy-to-use tool you can deploy to manage your TLS keys, certificates, and encryption. If you don't already have it on your server, install it now by entering:</p><pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot</code></pre><p>Run Certbot to fetch new certificates and keys:</p><pre><code>sudo certbot</code></pre><p>Follow the prompts, and select your statping-ng domain name from a list. Choose to automatically updrage all connections, and when you're returned to the prompt, restart Apache once more with:</p><pre><code>sudo service apache2 restart</code></pre><p>That's it.

Don't worry, you can leave most of these as they are. You'll need to give your service a name, and choose whether it's HTTP, TCP, UDP, gRPC, static, or if you just want an IMCP ping. A permalink URL means you can go directly to the status page of a service, so make it short and sweet. You'll find the page at <strong>your-domain.tld/service/permalink-name</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Public Service</strong> toggle is self explanatory, and you'll need to specify a <strong>Check Interval</strong>. This is how often you want statping-ng to check if your service is still alive - 60 seconds is good in our opinion.</p><p><strong>Service Endpoint</strong> is the URL you want to query - in most cases this will simply be the domain name or subdomain of your service, and by default the type will be a simple GET request.
