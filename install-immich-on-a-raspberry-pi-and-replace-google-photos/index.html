If you're on Windows, the easiest way to use SSH is with a dedicated client such as PuTTY.</p><p>Download PuTTY, and install it in the usual way. Open PuTTY from your start menu.</p><p>In the <strong>Host Name</strong> text box, type in the Pi hostname followed by .local.</p><p>If, when configuring the image earlier, you named your Pi as "pi", you would enter:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pi.local</code></pre><p>Choose <strong>SSH</strong> as the connection type, then hit <strong>Open</strong>.</p><p>You'll see a scary warning about the host's key, hit yes to add it to the registry.</p><p>A new window will open prompting you to enter your username, then your password. Do it.</p><h3 id="prepare-your-pi" class="wp-block-heading">Prepare your Pi</h3><p>There are a few things you need to do before you can install Immich on your Raspberry Pi. All you need to do is copy and paste the following commands, and enter your password when asked.</p><p>It's probably important to note that when entering a password in the Linux terminal, you won't see any response on the screen. Don't worry about this - just type your password and press <strong>Enter</strong> when you're done.</p><p>First off, you'll need to make sure all your packages are up to date:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade</code></pre><p>Install and enable Apache:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install apache2sudo systemctl start apache2sudo systemctl enable apache2</code></pre><p>All done? Sweet. It's worthwhile enabling some Apache modules. You won't need them all to install and use Immich, but they're useful to have:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo a2enmod rewrite http2 proxy proxy_http proxy_http2 proxy_wstunnel</code></pre><p>Now you need to install and enable Docker - a tool for managing containers:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install docker.iosudo systemctl start apache2sudo systemctl enable apache2</code></pre><p>Add your user to the Docker group:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo usermod -aG docker pi</code></pre><p>If your username is something other than "pi", use that instead.</p><p>Your membership of the Docker group won't take effect until you log out then back in again.</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>exit</code></pre><p>...will log you out. Log in again with PuTTY.</p><p>Docker Compose is a tool that makes managing Docker containers even easier. Unfortunately the version available in the standard repositories isn't up-to-date.</p><p>Manually install a recent version of Docker Compose, by pasting the following commands one at a time:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>wget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.21.0/docker-compose-linux-aarch64mv docker-compose-linux-aarch64 /usr/local/bin/docker-composesudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose</code></pre><p>Finally, you need to find your local IP address. Run:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>hostname -I</code></pre><p>You'll see a lit of numbers, with eacher group of four separated by dots, for instance, "192.168.1.45". Your Pi's local IP address is the first on the list. Write it down for later.</p><h2 id="install-immich-on-your-pi" class="wp-block-heading">Install Immich on your Pi</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/47/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md.webp" alt="Immich web interface showing a collection of photographs" width="768" height="386" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/47/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/47/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/47/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/47/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/47/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/47/responsive/immich-web-interface-1024x514-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>The hard work is done, and it's time to install Immich.</p><p>Create a directory for Immich, and a directory for your uploads:</p><pre class="wp-block-code">mkdir immich &amp;&amp; mkdir immich_uploads</pre><p>Move into the immich directory and download the Docker Compose file, and the environment file:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>wget https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.ymlwget -O .env https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/example.env</code></pre><p>Edit the environment file using the nano text editor:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>nano .env</code></pre><p>Find the upload location section and change it to read:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>UPLOAD_LOCATION=~/immich_uploads/</code></pre><p>Save and exit nano with <strong>Ctrl + O</strong> then <strong>Ctrl +X</strong>.</p><p>The following command will download docker images, and start the containers for Immich:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker-compose up -d</code></pre><p>This will take some time. Go take the dogs for a walk, or do your shopping.</p><p>When you return, open a browser on your PC, and in the url bar, enter:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>your-pi-local-ip-address:2286</code></pre><p>...substituting "your-pi-local-ip-address" for the actual local IP address you noted earlier. Click on the Get Started button and create the admin user by entering an email address and password. It doesn't have to be your real email address, and to be honest, it's probably better if it isn't.</p><p>Well done. Immich is up and running, but there are a few more things to do before you can start using it as a Google Photos alternative.</p><h2 id="make-your-immich-server-accessible-from-anywhere" class="wp-block-heading">Make your Immich server accessible from anywhere</h2><p>You should already own a domain name. Visit your registrar, and locate the <strong>DNS</strong> or <strong>Advanced DNS </strong>section. Delete any records already set, and create a new one.</p><p>Set the host as @ and the value as your home IP address. Set the TTL value as low as you can.</p><p>This will ensure that requests to your domain name are forwarded to your home IP address. You'll also need to ensure your router knows what to do with the requests.</p><p>Your router admin page is usually accessible by typing 192.168.1.1 into the address bar. If not, check the side of the router which will give you the correct address along with the default admin password.</p><p>Log into your router and look for a section called port forwarding or port management. Create a new entry for ports 80 and 443 – setting the value to your Pi's local IP address. Enter your domain name, and you should see the default Apache placeholder page.</p><p>Back on the Pi, create a config file for Apache:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/nano immich.conf</code></pre><p>In the new file, paste the following text, making sure to substitute your actual domain name:</p><p>In the new file, paste the following:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>ServerName your_domain.comProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:2283/ProxyPassReverse / http:/127.0.0.1:2283/ProxyPreserveHost On</code></pre><p>Save and exit nano again, and enter the following:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo a2ensite immich.confsudo service apache2 restart</code></pre><p>You should now be able to access your Immich instance by typing your domain name into any browser.</p><p>That's great, but you're not secured by TLS, meaning your traffic could be intercepted by a Person-in-the-middle attack. It's unlikely, but it's better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>Fortunately, there's a handty tool called Certbot which can fetch and install security Certificates for you, as well as upgrading connections to the more secure HTTPS protocol.</p><p>Install Certbot with:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install software-properties-commonsudo apt updatesudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbotsudo apt-get install python3-certbot-apache</code></pre><p>Run certbot with:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo certbot</code></pre><p>Answer the questions, then restart Apache again with:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo service apache2 restart</code></pre><p>That's it. You're done. Congratulations!
