The Leapster GS entered the world in 2012, and for a handheld kids' toy had fairly decent specs. Internal storage was measured in the low gigabytes, and its 500 MHz processor meant that it was, in theory, more powerful than Sony's still-in-production Playstation 2. The screen, though small, was a usable touchscreen and stylus, with good colour even in broad daylight. It had buttons and a D-pad designed for gaming. There was even a camera!</p><p>Like the Game Boy series, Leapster GS games came on a cartridge. Unlike Nintendo's offerings, the games were Flash-based, and exclusively angled towards educating children between the ages of four and nine. Remember Flash? It powered most of the games on the internet for a while, and is now lost to the sands of history.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-md.webp" alt="Official store listing for the Leapster GS" width="768" height="379" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>If you want to buy a spanky new Leapster GS, the Leapfrog website still has them listed for the bargain price of $49.99. Games are limited, pricey, and seldom available from the official source - although you can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LeapFrog-McStuffins-Learning-Platinum-LeapsterGS/dp/B00D38UBJ6?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=821c1687ea0c67b6aff2db2e2e67bed9&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Disney Doc McStuffins Learning Game</a> on Amazon for $25.99.</p><p>A quick eBay search shows a moderately active Leapster GS market place, with "spares and repairs" items with a Buy It Now price of £5, while at the upper end, a Leapster GS with a carry case and one original game is currently tagged at £45, and it doesn't even have battery packs.</p><p>The advice we'd give is that if you can find a decent one for under £20, bag it - and give it a new lease of life as an emulation station you can fit in your pocket.</p><h2 id="h-grab-a-used-bargain" class="wp-block-heading">Grab a used bargain</h2><p>Given that the Leapster is essentially useless to kids over the age of seven, it's not surprising that they end up being shoved to the back of a drawer until the child eventually leaves home for college, and parents have the unenviable task of sorting through two decades of discarded shit, and deciding what's actually worth keeping.</p><p>If they've been well looked after, artefacts such as the Leapster GS tend to end up in charity shops (The British version of a Thrift store, or possibly GoodWill).</p><p>We were lucky enough to find an almost perfect example for a fiver in a British Heart Foundation shop near to The Crow's nest. A fiver! OK, so the buttons had lost some of their paint, and it was a bit grimy, but otherwise it was in perfect nick. Even better, the four AA battery slots were filled with rechargeable cells, and it came with a charger. The lack of game cartridges to accompany the unit probably contributed to the price and failed to deter us one iota.</p><h2 id="h-we-use-arch-btw" class="wp-block-heading">We use (Retro)Arch BTW</h2><p>Unlike certain other consoles manufacturers that go to great lengths to ensure lock-in, and that you can't use your Steam library on a PS5, Leapfrog has no such protections in place, meaning that enterprising individuals have taken the time to develop alternate firmware for the device.</p><p>Retroleap works on the LeapsterGS and LeapPad2, and combines Retroarch, ARM-optimized emulator cores, and a buildroot root filesystem.</p><p>With Retroleap, converting the Leapfrog Leapster GS from a poorly conceived semi-educational toy to a kickass portable games console didn't take long. The biggest hurdle was finding a compatible cable.</p><p>By the time our pocket pal appeared on the scene, Micro-USB had been the industry standard for five years, so it's kind of baffling that Leapfrog went with the older Mini USB interface. You won't find one in your local supermarket or Poundland, and they were becoming a rarity even in 2012. Fortunately, we never throw a cable away, and after an afternoon sifting through three large bin bags of electronic paraphernalia, were able to locate one that had previously been used with a digital camera.</p><p>After that, it was a case of following the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/mac2612/retroleap">Retroleap GitHub repo</a>:</p><p>Making sure we had the necessary dependencies:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install sg3-utils git python</code></pre><p>Cloning sshflash:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>git clone https://github.com/mac2612/sshflash.git &amp;&amp; cd sshflash</code></pre><p>Downloading and unzipping the latest release into the sshflash directory:</p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>wget <a href="https://github.com/mac2612/retroleap/releases/download/v2.0.0-alpha10/retroleap_v2.0.0-alpha10.zip">https://github.com/mac2612/retroleap/releases/download/v2.0.0-alpha10/retroleap_v2.0.0-alpha10.zip</a><br><br>unzip retroleap_v2.0.0-alpha10.zip<br><br>rm retroleap_v2.0.0-alpha10.zip</code></pre><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-md.webp" alt="A dirty leapster GS held upright" width="768" height="352" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/50/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Did we mention our unit was dirty?

Some have even owned them, and they know the console as underwhelming, something their parents want them to have, and even the younger ones think its for babies. They'd rather have a Game Boy or a Switch.</p><p>They are shocked, nay, awed, when I hand it over just in time for them to see and hear a legendary finishing move on Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, battle through the jungles of Donkey Kong Country, unleash lightning as a god in Street Fighter 2 Turbo, or explore the world in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past - arguably the greatest console game of all time.</p><p>But is a humble Leapster GS running RetroLeap the GOAT?</p><p>We'd argue that yes it is. While mainstream, proper handheld consoles can run RetroArch, run the exact same games as RetroLeap, output to a TV, AND have their own exclusive titles, the price is a drawback.
