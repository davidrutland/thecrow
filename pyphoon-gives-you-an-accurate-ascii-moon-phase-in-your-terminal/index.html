We didn't, but it makes sense, and Pymoon will change your terminal moon's appearance accordingly.</p><p>Pymoon will also show the moon phase for any date you care to give it, so if you need a visual representation of the moon phase for your next date night or anniversary, Pyphoon is exactly the tool you need.</p><h2 id="h-install-pyphoon-on-linux-to-see-the-moon-in-your-terminal">Install Pyphoon on Linux to see the moon in your terminal</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/65/install-pyphoon-md.webp" alt="Using pip to install pyphhon in the Linux terminal" width="768" height="279" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/65/responsive/install-pyphoon-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/65/responsive/install-pyphoon-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/65/responsive/install-pyphoon-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/65/responsive/install-pyphoon-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/65/responsive/install-pyphoon-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/65/responsive/install-pyphoon-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>If your distro comes with support for snap packages (and you haven't disabled it), the easiest way to install Pyphoon is to pop open a terminal and enter:</p><pre data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><code>sudo snap install pyphoon --edge</code></pre><p>Otherwise, make sure you have git, python, and pip installed, then enter:</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/chubin/pyphoon &amp;&amp; cd pyphoon
