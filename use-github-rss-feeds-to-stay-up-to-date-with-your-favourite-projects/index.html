There are dozens of ways you can install software on Linux aside from your package manager including via docker and Podman - or compiling from source.</p><p>It's not always straightforward to find out if and when these projects have updated or if it's worth your while to update your local version. There may even be breaking changes, so every now and then you traipse off to the GitHub page of every piece of non-repo software you run and read the docs - just in case.</p><p>But if you subscribe to an RSS feed for those very same projects, you'll be informed as soon as something changes - and you can decide whether to take any further action.</p><p>Github RSS feeds can also work as a software discovery tool. Want a digest of what's trending in your area of interest? Set up an RSS feed! Want to keep an eye on a particular user or specific issues? You can create an RSS feed for that!</p><h2 id="h-get-updates-on-your-great-github-projects-with-rss">Get updates on your great GitHub projects with RSS</h2><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/75/immich-rss-md.webp" alt="RSS feed of Immich commits viewed in FreshRSS" width="768" height="396" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/75/responsive/immich-rss-md-xs.webp 300w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/75/responsive/immich-rss-md-sm.webp 480w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/75/responsive/immich-rss-md-md.webp 768w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/75/responsive/immich-rss-md-lg.webp 1024w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/75/responsive/immich-rss-md-xl.webp 1360w, https://thecrow.uk/media/posts/75/responsive/immich-rss-md-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p>Github provides <strong>atom </strong>RSS feeds for some, but not all, of aspects of projects.</p><p>There's no ready-made feed through which you can monitor changes to a project's main page for instance.
